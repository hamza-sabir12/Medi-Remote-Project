<ol>

<li>The project utilizes technologies such as React JS with Mui (Material-UI).</li>
<li>Grid layout is implemented to create responsive design pages.</li>
<li>Routing functionality is applied throughout the project.</li>
<li>API integration is carried out using Postman.</li>
<li>All text fields in the Signup and Login pages have applied validations.</li>
<li>An admin role is implemented for routing. If the user logs in with admin privileges, they are directed to the admin page; otherwise, they are directed to the user page.</li>
<li>In the UserDetails component, records were fetched from the API and displayed in a data grid table.</li>
<li>I have also added the feature to download PDF files containing these records.</li>
<li>I have also added the appointment feature to this. Its functionality is to get the appointment date from the user and display it in a table. If there is a mistake in taking the appointment date, the user can update it and make changes.</li>
